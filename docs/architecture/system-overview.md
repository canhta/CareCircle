### Domain-Driven Design Structure

The system is organized into 6 bounded contexts:

1. **Identity & Access Context (IAC)**
   - User authentication and authorization
   - Profile management and permissions
   - Guest mode and multi-factor authentication

2. **Care Group Context (CGC)**
   - Family care coordination
   - Role-based group management
   - Task assignment and tracking

3. **Health Data Context (HDC)**
   - Health metrics collection and analysis
   - Device integration (HealthKit, Health Connect)
   - Trend detection and insights

4. **Medication Context (MDC)**
   - Prescription management and OCR processing
   - Medication scheduling and reminders
   - Adherence tracking and analytics

5. **Notification Context (NOC)**
   - Multi-channel communication (push, SMS, email)
   - Intelligent delivery timing
   - User preference management

6. **AI Assistant Context (AAC)**
   - Conversational health guidance
   - Personalized health insights
   - Voice and text interactions
