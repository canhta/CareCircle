# Healthcare Compliance Architecture

## Overview

CareCircle is designed with healthcare compliance at its core, ensuring adherence to HIPAA, GDPR, and other healthcare data protection regulations. This document serves as the single source of truth for all healthcare compliance requirements across the platform.

## Regulatory Compliance

### HIPAA Compliance

**Protected Health Information (PHI) Handling:**

- All PHI is encrypted at rest and in transit
- Access controls based on minimum necessary principle
- Comprehensive audit logging for all PHI access
- Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) with all third-party services

**Administrative Safeguards:**

- Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
- Regular security training and awareness programs
- Incident response procedures for data breaches
- Periodic security assessments and audits

**Physical Safeguards:**

- Secure data centers with controlled access
- Workstation security controls
- Device and media controls for mobile applications

**Technical Safeguards:**

- Access control mechanisms with unique user identification
- Automatic logoff for inactive sessions
- Encryption and decryption of PHI
- Integrity controls to prevent unauthorized alteration

### GDPR Compliance

**Data Subject Rights:**

- Right to access personal data
- Right to rectification of inaccurate data
- Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten")
- Right to data portability
- Right to object to processing

**Privacy by Design:**

- Data minimization principles
- Purpose limitation for data collection
- Storage limitation with automatic deletion
- Consent management systems

## Data Classification

### PHI (Protected Health Information)

- Health records and medical history
- Medication information and prescriptions
- Health device data and measurements
- Care provider communications
- Insurance and billing information

### PII (Personally Identifiable Information)

- Names, addresses, phone numbers
- Email addresses and social media profiles
- Device identifiers and IP addresses
- Biometric data (fingerprints, face recognition)

### Sensitive Data

- Authentication credentials
- Financial information
- Family relationships and care group data
- AI conversation history with health context

## Security Architecture

### Encryption Standards

**Data at Rest:**

- AES-256 encryption for database storage
- Encrypted file systems for log storage
- Key management using cloud HSM services
- Regular key rotation policies

**Data in Transit:**

- TLS 1.3 for all API communications
- Certificate pinning for mobile applications
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive communications
- Secure WebSocket connections for real-time data

### Access Control

**Authentication:**

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) required
- Firebase Authentication with healthcare extensions
- Biometric authentication for mobile devices
- Session management with automatic timeout

**Authorization:**

- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC) for fine-grained permissions
- Context-aware access decisions
- Principle of least privilege enforcement

### Audit and Monitoring

**Audit Logging:**

- Comprehensive logging of all PHI access
- Immutable audit trails with digital signatures
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
- Log retention policies compliant with regulations

**Monitoring:**

- Continuous security monitoring
- Anomaly detection for unusual access patterns
- Automated incident response triggers
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing

## Data Handling Procedures

### Data Collection
