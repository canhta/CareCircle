# Cross-Cutting Concerns Architecture

## Overview

This document defines the architectural patterns and implementations for cross-cutting concerns that span multiple bounded contexts in the CareCircle platform. These concerns are implemented consistently across all contexts to ensure system coherence and maintainability.

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication Strategy

**Single Source of Truth:** Firebase Authentication across all contexts

**Implementation Pattern:**

- Firebase ID tokens for user authentication
- Context-specific authorization logic
- Consistent authentication middleware across all APIs
- Guest mode support with device-based identification

**Cross-Context Integration:**

- Identity & Access Context manages user profiles and roles
- All other contexts validate Firebase tokens
- Role-based permissions enforced at context boundaries
- Shared authentication state across mobile application

### Authorization Model

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**

- Patient: Basic health data access
- Caregiver: Extended family member access
- Healthcare Provider: Professional access levels
- System Admin: Platform administration

**Context-Specific Permissions:**

- Each bounded context defines its own permission model
- Fine-grained access control for sensitive operations
- Data sharing permissions managed through Care Group context
- Audit logging for all authorization decisions

## Error Handling and Resilience

### Standardized Error Response Format

```typescript
interface ErrorResponse {
  error: {
    code: string;
    message: string;
    details?: any;
    timestamp: string;
    correlationId: string;
    context: string;
  };
}
```

### Error Handling Patterns

**Backend (NestJS):**

- Global exception filters for consistent error responses
- Context-specific error codes and messages
- Healthcare-compliant error logging (no PHI in logs)
- Circuit breaker pattern for external service calls

**Mobile (Flutter):**

- Centralized error handling with user-friendly messages
- Offline-first error recovery strategies
- Healthcare-specific error categorization
- Graceful degradation for non-critical features

### Resilience Patterns

- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Circuit breakers for external dependencies
- Bulkhead isolation between contexts
- Graceful degradation strategies

## Logging and Monitoring

### Logging Architecture

**Structured Logging Format:**

- JSON-formatted logs with consistent schema
- Correlation IDs for request tracing
- Context identifiers for bounded context isolation
- Healthcare-compliant PII/PHI sanitization

**Log Levels and Usage:**

- ERROR: System errors requiring immediate attention
- WARN: Recoverable errors and performance issues
- INFO: Business events and user actions
- DEBUG: Development and troubleshooting information

**Cross-Context Correlation:**

- Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
- Request correlation across context boundaries
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection
- Centralized log aggregation and analysis

### Monitoring Strategy

**Application Metrics:**

- Response times and throughput per context
- Error rates and availability metrics
- Resource utilization and performance indicators
- Business metrics and user engagement

**Healthcare-Specific Monitoring:**

- PHI access patterns and anomaly detection
- Compliance audit trail monitoring
- Data quality and integrity checks
- Patient safety and critical alert monitoring

## Data Validation and Sanitization

### Input Validation

**Validation Strategy:**

- Schema-based validation using JSON Schema or similar
- Context-specific business rule validation
- Healthcare data format validation (HL7, FHIR)
- Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks

**Implementation Pattern:**

- DTO validation at API boundaries
- Domain model validation in business logic
- Database constraint validation as final safeguard
- Client-side validation for user experience

### Data Sanitization

**PII/PHI Protection:**

- Automatic detection and masking of sensitive data
- Configurable sanitization rules per data type
- Audit logging of sanitization activities
- Regular expression and ML-based detection

**Output Sanitization:**

- Response filtering based on user permissions
- Dynamic data masking for non-authorized users
- Secure data export and reporting
- API response sanitization middleware

## Caching and Performance

### Caching Strategy

**Multi-Level Caching:**

- Application-level caching with Redis
- Database query result caching
- CDN caching for static assets
- Mobile application local caching

**Cache Invalidation:**

- Event-driven cache invalidation
- TTL-based expiration policies
- Manual cache clearing for critical updates
- Distributed cache coordination

### Performance Optimization

**Database Optimization:**

- Query optimization and indexing strategies
- Connection pooling and resource management
- Read replicas for query distribution
- TimescaleDB for time-series health data

**API Performance:**

- Response compression and optimization
- Pagination for large result sets
- Asynchronous processing for heavy operations
- Rate limiting and throttling

## Configuration Management

### Environment Configuration

**Configuration Strategy:**

- Environment-specific configuration files
- Secret management with secure storage
- Feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Runtime configuration updates

**Cross-Context Configuration:**

- Shared configuration for common settings
- Context-specific configuration isolation
- Configuration validation and type safety
- Centralized configuration management

### Feature Flags

**Implementation:**

- A/B testing capabilities
- Gradual feature rollouts
- Emergency feature toggles
- User-specific feature enablement

## API Design and Versioning

### API Design Standards

**RESTful API Principles:**

- Resource-based URL design
- HTTP method semantics
- Consistent response formats
- HATEOAS for discoverability

**GraphQL Integration:**

- Type-safe schema definition
- Efficient data fetching
- Real-time subscriptions
- Schema stitching across contexts

### API Versioning Strategy

**Versioning Approach:**

- Semantic versioning for API releases
- Backward compatibility maintenance
- Deprecation policies and timelines
- Client SDK versioning alignment

## Security Patterns

### Data Protection

**Encryption Standards:**

- AES-256 for data at rest
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive communications
- Key management and rotation policies

**Access Control:**

- Zero-trust security model
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular access reviews and audits
- Automated access provisioning and deprovisioning

### Threat Protection

**Security Measures:**

- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection and XSS prevention
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Security headers and CSRF protection

## Integration Patterns

### External Service Integration

**Integration Strategy:**

- Anti-corruption layers for external systems
- Circuit breakers for service resilience
- Adapter patterns for API compatibility
- Event-driven integration where possible

**Healthcare Integrations:**

- HL7 FHIR standard compliance
- Medical device integration protocols
- Healthcare provider system integration
- Insurance and billing system connectivity

### Inter-Context Communication

**Communication Patterns:**

- Synchronous API calls for immediate data needs
- Asynchronous events for state changes
- Shared data access through well-defined interfaces
- Message queues for reliable delivery

## Testing Strategies

### Cross-Cutting Testing
