# Authentication Flow Visual Design

_This document is a placeholder for the visual design specifications of the authentication flow. The actual document will contain visual mockups, design assets, and detailed styling information._

## Included Visual Elements (Planned)

1. **Screen Mockups**

   - High-fidelity mockups for all authentication screens
   - Dark and light mode variants
   - Responsive designs for different screen sizes

2. **Component Library**

   - Authentication-specific UI components
   - Style specifications for input fields, buttons, and dialogs
   - Animation specifications for transitions and feedback

3. **Design System Elements**

   - Color palette for authentication screens
   - Typography specifications
   - Icon set for authentication elements

4. **Interaction Design**

   - Loading state animations
   - Success/error state visualizations

5. **Platform-Specific Designs**

## Implementation Notes

This is a placeholder document. The complete visual design specifications will be developed by the UI/UX design team based on the functional requirements detailed in the [Authentication Flow UI/UX Specification](../textual/UM-010_authentication_flow.md) document.

The visual design will maintain consistency with the overall CareCircle design system while emphasizing clarity, accessibility, and ease of use for the authentication process.

Design decisions will prioritize:

- Intuitive visual hierarchy
- Clear affordances for interactive elements
- Accessible color contrast and text sizing
- Consistent branding across authentication journey
- Platform-appropriate visual patterns
