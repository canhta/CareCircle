## Implementation Notes

This is a placeholder document. The complete visual design specifications will be developed by the UI/UX design team based on the functional requirements detailed in the [Notification System UI/UX Specification](../textual/NSS-001_notification_system.md) document.

The visual design will maintain consistency with the overall CareCircle design system while emphasizing the unique requirements of notifications, including:

- Clear visual hierarchy to emphasize important information
- Distinct visual treatments for different notification priorities
- Culturally appropriate visual elements for Southeast Asian markets
- Accessible design elements that work across all supported platforms
