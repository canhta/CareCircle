# CareCircle Feature Specifications

This directory contains detailed feature specifications for the CareCircle platform, organized by feature ID. These documents provide comprehensive user stories, requirements, and implementation guidance for features that may span multiple Domain-Driven Design (DDD) modules.

## Relationship with Module Documentation

While the [modules directory](../modules/) contains technical implementation details organized by bounded contexts (following DDD principles), this directory organizes features based on user-facing functionality. A single feature may require implementation across multiple modules.

## Feature List

| Feature ID | Feature Name                   | Description                              | Primary Module | Secondary Modules |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| UM-010     | Firebase Authentication System | User registration, login, and guest mode | IAC            | -                 |
| FCC-001    | Family Care Coordination       | Family/group creation and management     | CGC            | IAC               |
| MM-001     | Medication Management          | Tracking and reminders for medications   | MDC            | NOC, HDC          |
| NSS-001    | Notification System            | Multi-channel alerts and notifications   | NOC            | All modules       |
| AHA-001    | AI Health Assistant            | Conversational health interface          | AAC            | HDC, MDC          |

## Integration Documents

This directory also contains technical integration documents that explain how different modules interact:

- [Bounded Context Communication](./technical_bounded_context_communication.md) - How modules communicate with each other
- [AI Agent Implementation](./technical_ai_agent_implementation.md) - Technical details for AI functionality

## UI/UX Specifications

Detailed UI/UX specifications can be found in the [uiux](./uiux/) directory:

- Textual mockups: Detailed text descriptions of each screen and interaction
- Visual mockups: Visual designs and wireframes for the application

## Using These Documents

When implementing features:

1. Start with the feature document to understand the complete requirements
2. Reference the relevant module documents for implementation details
3. Follow the integration guidelines when connecting multiple modules
4. Use UI/UX specifications for interface implementation

## Avoiding Documentation Duplication

To minimize duplication:

1. Feature documents focus on "what to implement" from a user perspective
2. Module documents focus on "how to implement" from a technical perspective
3. Reference related documents rather than duplicating information
