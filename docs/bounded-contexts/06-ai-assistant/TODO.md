# AI Assistant Context TODO List

## Module Information
- **Module**: AI Assistant Context (AAC)
- **Context**: Conversational AI, Health Insights, Intelligent Assistance
- **Implementation Order**: 6
- **Dependencies**: All other contexts for comprehensive AI functionality

## Current Sprint

### Completed (Phase 3 - ‚úÖ 100% Complete)
- [x] Design conversation and knowledge domain models with DDD patterns
- [x] Implement OpenAI API integration with healthcare-focused system prompts
- [x] Create context management for conversations with health data integration
- [x] Implement conversation management service with full OpenAI integration
- [x] Create chat UI components and voice interaction with healthcare theming
- [x] Set up database schema and repository layer
- [x] Configure OpenAI API key for production functionality - Confirmed configured
- [x] Complete health context integration with HealthProfile, HealthMetrics, and HealthAnalytics services
- [x] Implement comprehensive error handling with fallback responses
- [x] Add privacy filtering and medical disclaimers for AI responses
- [x] Create AI assistant as central navigation element (MainAppShell with central FAB)
- [x] Build dedicated AIAssistantHomeScreen with health context indicators
- [x] Resolve flutter_chat_ui v2.6.2 compatibility issues
  - **Issue**: API breaking changes from old types.Message to new ChatController architecture
  - **Action**: Complete migration to ChatController-based API with InMemoryChatController
  - **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - iOS build successful, all lint issues resolved

### ‚úÖ Authentication Integration (RESOLVED)
- [x] Fixed authentication system - AiAssistantModule now uses FirebaseAuthGuard exclusively
- [x] Removed JwtService dependency - all modules use consistent Firebase authentication
- [x] Verified ConversationController properly uses @UseGuards(FirebaseAuthGuard)

### ‚úÖ Ready for Production Testing
- [x] End-to-end AI conversation testing
  - **Status**: ‚úÖ READY - Mobile authentication aligned with Firebase-only backend
  - **Update**: Mobile app now uses Firebase ID tokens for all API calls
- [ ] Implement Milvus vector database integration
- [ ] Create health insights generation algorithms

## Backlog
