# Feature Specification: AI Health Chat (AHA-001)

## Overview

**Feature ID:** AHA-001  
**Feature Name:** AI Health Chat  
**User Story:** As a user, I want to ask health-related questions to an AI assistant that has context of my health data for personalized guidance.

## Detailed Description

The AI Health Chat feature provides users with an intelligent conversational interface to ask health-related questions and receive personalized responses based on their specific health context. The assistant leverages Large Language Models (specifically OpenAI's GPT models) combined with the user's personal health data to provide contextually relevant, accurate, and personalized health information.

## Business Requirements

1. **Personalized Health Guidance:** The AI should provide responses tailored to the user's specific health context.
2. **Contextual Awareness:** The system should maintain conversation context across multiple interactions.
3. **Health Data Integration:** The AI should have access to relevant user health data with appropriate privacy controls.
4. **Medical Information Accuracy:** All health information should be medically accurate and properly cited.
5. **Accessibility:** The chat interface should be accessible to all users, including elderly users and those with disabilities.
6. **Multilingual Support:** Support for Vietnamese and English languages.
7. **Privacy Protection:** Strong PHI/PII protection measures during AI processing.
8. **Fallback Mechanisms:** Graceful handling when the AI cannot provide an appropriate response.

## User Experience

### Alternative Flows

1. **Voice Interaction:**
   - User taps microphone icon
   - User speaks their health question
   - System transcribes and processes
   - AI responds with text and optional voice output

2. **No Internet Connection:**
   - User attempts to send a message
   - System notifies user of connection issue
   - User's message is queued for sending when connection is restored
   - System shows cached responses for common questions

3. **Question Outside Medical Scope:**
   - User asks a question beyond the system's capabilities
   - AI acknowledges limitations and suggests consulting a healthcare professional
   - System offers to connect user with appropriate care resources

## Open Questions / Decisions

1. Should we implement a "medical disclaimer" for all health-related responses?
