# CareCircle Features

This directory contains user-facing feature specifications for the CareCircle platform.

## Feature Overview

Features are organized by their primary functionality and may span multiple bounded contexts:

### Core Features
- [Feature Catalog](./feature-catalog.md) - Complete list of platform features

### Major Features

#### Health Management
- [AHA-001: AI Health Chat](./aha-001-ai-health-chat.md) - Conversational AI for health guidance
- [MM-001: Prescription Scanning](./mm-001-prescription-scanning.md) - Prescription tracking and adherence

#### Care Coordination
- [FCC-001: Care Group Creation](./fcc-001-care-group-creation.md) - Multi-user care management
- [NSS-001: AI-Powered Smart Notification](./nss-001-ai-powered-smart-notification.md) - Intelligent communication

#### User Management
- [UM-010: Firebase Authentication](./um-010-firebase-authentication.md) - Authentication and profile management

## Feature Structure

Each feature document contains:

### User Stories
- Primary user personas and their needs
- User journey flows and interactions
- Acceptance criteria for feature completion

### Technical Requirements
- Functional requirements and specifications
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.)
- Integration requirements with other features

### Implementation Notes
- Bounded context mapping
- API requirements and contracts
- UI/UX considerations

## Feature-to-Context Mapping

Features often span multiple bounded contexts:

| Feature | Primary Context | Secondary Contexts |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| AI Health Chat | AI Assistant | Health Data, Medication, Care Group |
| Prescription Scanning | Medication | Health Data, Notification, Care Group |
| Care Group Creation | Care Group | Identity & Access, Health Data, Notification |
| AI-Powered Smart Notification | Notification | All contexts |
| Firebase Authentication | Identity & Access | Care Group |

## Feature Development Process

1. **Feature Specification** - Define user stories and requirements
2. **Context Analysis** - Identify which bounded contexts are involved
3. **API Design** - Define contracts between contexts
4. **Implementation Planning** - Break down into context-specific tasks
5. **Development** - Implement across relevant contexts
6. **Integration Testing** - Verify cross-context functionality
7. **User Acceptance Testing** - Validate against user stories

## Feature Status Tracking

Feature implementation status is tracked in the bounded context TODO.md files:
- Tasks are broken down by bounded context
- Dependencies between contexts are clearly marked
- Progress is tracked at the implementation level
