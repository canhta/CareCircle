# CareCircle Planning

This directory contains project planning, roadmaps, and implementation guidance for the CareCircle platform.

## Planning Documents

### Implementation Planning
- [Implementation Roadmap](./implementation-roadmap.md) - Comprehensive development plan organized by DDD bounded contexts

## Implementation Strategy

### Domain-Driven Design Approach
The CareCircle platform follows DDD principles with a clear implementation order:

1. **Foundation First** - Identity & Access Context provides authentication
2. **Core Functionality** - Health Data and Care Group contexts
3. **Enhanced Features** - Medication and Notification contexts
4. **Intelligence Layer** - AI Assistant context integrates everything

### Development Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-2)
- Identity & Access Context implementation
- Basic authentication and user management
- Core infrastructure setup

#### Phase 2: Core Features (Months 2-4)
- Care Group Context for family coordination
- Health Data Context for metrics and device integration
- Basic mobile and backend functionality

#### Phase 3: Enhanced Functionality (Months 4-6)
- Medication Context for prescription management
- Notification Context for smart communications
- Advanced features and integrations

#### Phase 4: Intelligence & Optimization (Months 6-8)
- AI Assistant Context implementation
- Performance optimization
- Advanced analytics and insights

### Cross-Cutting Concerns

Throughout all phases:
- **Security & Compliance** - HIPAA compliance, data encryption
- **Performance & Scalability** - Database optimization, caching
- **Analytics & Monitoring** - System health, user behavior tracking
- **User Experience** - Accessibility, elder-friendly design

## Task Management

### AI Agent Workflow
1. **Context Selection** - Choose appropriate bounded context
2. **Task Planning** - Add tasks to context TODO.md file
3. **Implementation** - Follow technical specifications
4. **Progress Tracking** - Update TODO.md with completion status
5. **Cross-Reference** - Link to related features and architecture docs

### Progress Tracking
- Each bounded context has its own TODO.md file
- Dependencies between contexts are clearly marked
- Implementation status is tracked at the task level
- Regular reviews ensure alignment with overall roadmap

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
- Unit testing for individual components
- Integration testing for cross-context functionality
- End-to-end testing for complete user journeys
- Performance testing for scalability

### Code Quality
- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint and Prettier for code consistency
- Code reviews for all changes
- Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- Third-party API dependencies (Firebase, OpenAI)
- Data migration and consistency
- Performance at scale
- Security vulnerabilities

### Mitigation Strategies
- Fallback mechanisms for external services
- Comprehensive testing and monitoring
- Regular security audits
- Incremental rollout strategy
