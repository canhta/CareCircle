# CareCircle Documentation Structure

## Overview

This document outlines the optimized documentation structure for the CareCircle platform, designed for efficient AI agent context retrieval, developer navigation, and healthcare compliance requirements.

## Documentation Principles

### Single Source of Truth

Each piece of information exists in only one authoritative location to eliminate duplication and ensure consistency:

- **Technology Stack**: [System Overview](./architecture/system-overview.md#technology-stack)
- **Healthcare Compliance**: [Healthcare Compliance Architecture](./architecture/healthcare-compliance.md)
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: [Cross-Cutting Concerns Architecture](./architecture/cross-cutting-concerns.md)
- **Setup Instructions**: [Development Environment Setup](./setup/development-environment.md)
- **DDD Bounded Contexts**: [Bounded Contexts Overview](./bounded-contexts/README.md)

### Cross-Reference System

All documents use consistent relative path references to authoritative sources:

```markdown
<!-- Reference to technology stack -->

For technology stack details, see [System Overview](./architecture/system-overview.md#technology-stack)

<!-- Reference to healthcare compliance -->

For regulatory requirements, see [Healthcare Compliance](./architecture/healthcare-compliance.md)

<!-- Reference to shared patterns -->

For authentication patterns, see [Cross-Cutting Concerns](./architecture/cross-cutting-concerns.md#authentication-and-authorization)
```

## Navigation Patterns

### For AI Agents

1. **Start with**: [Main Documentation Hub](./README.md)
2. **Architecture Context**: [System Overview](./architecture/system-overview.md) for technology stack
3. **Implementation Context**: [Bounded Contexts Overview](./bounded-contexts/README.md) for current status
4. **Specific Concerns**: [Cross-Cutting Concerns](./architecture/cross-cutting-concerns.md) for shared patterns
5. **Compliance Requirements**: [Healthcare Compliance](./architecture/healthcare-compliance.md) for regulatory needs

### For Developers

1. **Getting Started**: [Development Environment Setup](./setup/development-environment.md)
2. **Understanding Architecture**: [System Overview](./architecture/system-overview.md)
3. **Implementation Guidance**: Specific bounded context documentation
4. **Feature Specifications**: [Feature Catalog](./features/feature-catalog.md)
5. **Design Guidelines**: [Design System](./design/design-system.md)

## Authoritative Sources

### Technology Stack

**Location**: [System Overview](./architecture/system-overview.md#technology-stack)
**Contains**: Complete technology stack for backend, mobile, and infrastructure
**Referenced by**: All architecture documents, setup guides, and implementation docs

### Healthcare Compliance

**Location**: [Healthcare Compliance Architecture](./architecture/healthcare-compliance.md)
**Contains**: HIPAA, GDPR, security requirements, audit logging, data protection
**Referenced by**: All bounded contexts, features, and implementation guides

### Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Location**: [Cross-Cutting Concerns Architecture](./architecture/cross-cutting-concerns.md)
**Contains**: Authentication, error handling, logging, validation, caching, security patterns
**Referenced by**: Backend and mobile architecture documents, bounded contexts

### Setup Instructions

**Location**: [Development Environment Setup](./setup/development-environment.md)
**Contains**: Complete setup including Firebase, mobile-backend connectivity, troubleshooting
**Referenced by**: Main README, TODO files, architecture documents

### DDD Implementation Status

**Location**: [Bounded Contexts Overview](./bounded-contexts/README.md)
**Contains**: Implementation status, dependencies, communication patterns
**Referenced by**: Planning documents, TODO files, feature specifications

## Cross-Reference Guidelines

### When to Reference vs. Duplicate

- **Reference**: Technology stack, compliance requirements, shared patterns, setup instructions
- **Duplicate**: Context-specific examples, implementation details, bounded context specifics

### Reference Format

```markdown
<!-- Good: Clear reference with context -->

For authentication implementation patterns, see [Cross-Cutting Concerns](./architecture/cross-cutting-concerns.md#authentication-and-authorization).

<!-- Good: Reference with specific section -->

Technology stack details are maintained in [System Overview](./architecture/system-overview.md#technology-stack).

<!-- Avoid: Vague references -->

See the architecture documentation for more details.
```

### Update Procedures

When updating authoritative sources:

1. Update the single source of truth document
2. Verify all references point to the correct sections
3. Update any context-specific examples that may be affected
4. Update TODO.md files if structure changes

## Benefits for AI Agents

### Context Retrieval Efficiency

- **Single Sources**: Eliminates conflicting information
- **Clear Navigation**: Predictable document structure
- **Authoritative References**: Always points to most current information
- **Bounded Context Alignment**: Matches system architecture

### Decision Making Support

- **Technology Choices**: Centralized in system overview
- **Compliance Requirements**: Comprehensive in healthcare compliance doc
- **Implementation Patterns**: Standardized in cross-cutting concerns
- **Current Status**: Tracked in bounded contexts overview

### Reduced Cognitive Load

- **Consistent Structure**: Predictable document organization
- **Clear Ownership**: Each document has single, clear purpose
- **Minimal Duplication**: Reduces conflicting information
- **Healthcare Focus**: Compliance considerations integrated throughout

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Regular Reviews

- Monthly review of cross-references for accuracy
- Quarterly review of authoritative sources for completeness
- Update documentation structure when adding new bounded contexts
- Verify all TODO.md references after structural changes

### Quality Assurance

- All new documents must reference appropriate authoritative sources
- No duplication of information from single sources of truth
- Healthcare compliance considerations must be referenced in all implementation docs
- Cross-cutting concerns must be referenced in architecture documents

This optimized structure ensures efficient AI agent context retrieval while maintaining clear navigation paths for human developers and comprehensive healthcare compliance coverage.
