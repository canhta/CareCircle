## Project Structure

This mobile UI/UX refactoring project is organized into 4 phases, each with dedicated implementation and task tracking documents:

### Phase 1: Foundation & Design System (Weeks 1-2)
- **Implementation Plan**: [`phase1-foundation-design-system.md`](./phase1-foundation-design-system.md)
- **Task Tracking**: [`phase1-foundation-todo.md`](./phase1-foundation-todo.md)
- **Objective**: Establish comprehensive design system foundation
- **Key Deliverables**: Modular token system, enhanced theming, core accessibility compliance

### Phase 2: Component Library & Patterns (Weeks 3-4)
- **Implementation Plan**: [`phase2-component-library.md`](./phase2-component-library.md)
- **Task Tracking**: [`phase2-component-todo.md`](./phase2-component-todo.md)
- **Objective**: Build healthcare-specific component library
- **Key Deliverables**: Healthcare components, form components, vital signs displays

### Phase 3: Screen-Level Refactoring (Weeks 5-6)
- **Implementation Plan**: [`phase3-screen-refactoring.md`](./phase3-screen-refactoring.md)
- **Task Tracking**: [`phase3-screen-todo.md`](./phase3-screen-todo.md)
- **Objective**: Apply new design system to existing screens
- **Key Deliverables**: Refactored screens, responsive design, accessibility improvements

### Phase 4: Advanced Features & Polish (Weeks 7-8)
- **Implementation Plan**: [`phase4-advanced-features.md`](./phase4-advanced-features.md)
- **Task Tracking**: [`phase4-advanced-todo.md`](./phase4-advanced-todo.md)
- **Objective**: Advanced UI patterns and comprehensive testing
- **Key Deliverables**: Micro-interactions, performance optimization, testing framework

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive refactoring transforms the CareCircle mobile application into a best-in-class healthcare app following modern UI/UX standards, accessibility requirements, and healthcare compliance guidelines.

**Key Objectives**:
- Establish comprehensive design system foundation
- Build healthcare-specific component library
- Implement WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility compliance
- Optimize performance for healthcare data
- Ensure HIPAA UI compliance throughout

## Overall Dependencies & Timeline

### Critical Path
```
Phase 1 (Design Tokens) → Phase 2 (Components) → Phase 3 (Screens) → Phase 4 (Polish)
```

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- Accessibility auditing can run parallel with Phase 1
- Testing framework setup can run parallel with Phase 2
- Documentation updates can run throughout all phases
- Performance monitoring can start in Phase 3

### Key Milestones

**Week 2 Milestone**: Design system foundation complete
- All token files created and integrated
- Theme system enhanced
- Core accessibility compliance established

**Week 4 Milestone**: Component library complete
- Healthcare-specific components implemented
- Form components with medical validation
- Vital signs display components functional

**Week 6 Milestone**: Screen refactoring complete
- All major screens updated with new design system
- Responsive design implemented
- Accessibility improvements validated

**Week 8 Milestone**: Project complete
- Advanced features implemented
- Performance optimized

## Success Metrics & Compliance

**Detailed metrics and compliance requirements are documented in each phase's implementation plan.**

### Key Targets
- **Accessibility**: 100% WCAG 2.2 AA compliance
- **Performance**: <3s load times, 60fps animations
- **Healthcare Compliance**: Full HIPAA UI compliance
- **Test Coverage**: >90% component test coverage

### Risk Mitigation
- Phase-by-phase rollout with rollback capability
- Comprehensive testing at each milestone
- Regular stakeholder reviews and approval gates

## Getting Started

1. **Review Phase 1 Documents**: Start with foundation and design system
2. **Set Up Development Environment**: Prepare testing and validation tools
3. **Assign Team Members**: Allocate resources to each phase
4. **Begin Phase 1**: Follow the detailed implementation plan

## Document Maintenance
