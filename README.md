```

### Production Deploy (Vietnam Market)

```bash
# 1. Setup GCP
export PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID
./scripts/setup-gcp-production.sh

# 2. Add GitHub Secrets (GCP_PROJECT_ID, GCP_SA_KEY)

# 3. Update secrets
echo 'your-database-url' | gcloud secrets versions add database-url --data-file=-
echo 'your-vector-db-url' | gcloud secrets versions add vector-db-url --data-file=-
echo 'your-openai-key' | gcloud secrets versions add openai-api-key --data-file=-
gcloud secrets versions add firebase-credentials --data-file=firebase-key.json

# 4. Deploy
git push origin main
