### Phase 3 - AI Assistant Implementation (85% Complete)

- [x] Core AI chat interface components with flutter_chat_ui
  - **Location**: mobile/lib/features/ai-assistant/screens/ai_chat_screen.dart
  - **Status**: Complete chat UI with healthcare theming, message bubbles, typing indicators
- [x] AI assistant service integration with backend REST API
  - **Location**: mobile/lib/features/ai-assistant/services/ai_assistant_service.dart
  - **Status**: Full conversation management and message handling
- [x] Voice input/output components (speech-to-text, text-to-speech)
  - **Location**: mobile/lib/features/ai-assistant/widgets/voice_input_button.dart
  - **Status**: Complete voice recording and speech processing
- [x] Healthcare-themed chat interface with Material Design 3 adaptations
  - **Location**: mobile/lib/features/ai-assistant/widgets/healthcare_chat_theme.dart
  - **Status**: Medical context optimizations and accessibility features
- [x] Emergency detection and escalation widgets
  - **Location**: mobile/lib/features/ai-assistant/widgets/emergency_detection_widget.dart
  - **Status**: Emergency keyword detection with escalation protocols
- [x] Health context integration (backend builds context automatically using JWT user ID)
  - **Status**: AI responses include personalized health data, metrics, and analytics
- [x] AI assistant as central navigation element
  - **Location**: mobile/lib/features/home/screens/main_app_shell.dart
  - **Status**: MainAppShell with AI assistant as central FAB, dedicated AIAssistantHomeScreen

**Remaining**: End-to-end testing blocked by backend authentication integration issue (JwtService dependency injection)

## Known Issues & Troubleshooting

### Freezed Code Generation Issues

**Issue**: "Missing concrete implementations" errors when using Freezed with json_serializable
- **Symptoms**: Analysis errors like `Missing concrete implementations of 'getter mixin _$User on Object.createdAt'`
- **Root Cause**: Missing `abstract` keyword in Freezed class declarations
- **Solution**: Use `abstract class` instead of `class` for single-constructor Freezed models
- **Example**:
  ```dart
  // ❌ Incorrect - causes "missing concrete implementations" errors
  @freezed
  class User with _$User {
    const factory User({...}) = _User;
    factory User.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$UserFromJson(json);
  }

  // ✅ Correct - works properly with code generation
  @freezed
  abstract class User with _$User {
    const factory User({...}) = _User;
    factory User.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$UserFromJson(json);
  }
  ```

- **Fixed In**: Auth models migration (2025-07-08)
