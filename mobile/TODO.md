  - **Location**: `mobile/lib/features/auth/services/auth_service.dart`
  - **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Custom token refresh logic removed

- [x] **HIGH**: Update authentication state management to work without JWT tokens
  - **Action**: Modify `AuthState` to not store access/refresh tokens, use Firebase auth state
  - **Location**: `mobile/lib/features/auth/providers/auth_provider.dart`

## Known Issues & Troubleshooting

### Freezed Code Generation Issues

**Issue**: "Missing concrete implementations" errors when using Freezed with json_serializable

- **Symptoms**: Analysis errors like `Missing concrete implementations of 'getter mixin _$User on Object.createdAt'`
- **Root Cause**: Missing `abstract` keyword in Freezed class declarations
- **Solution**: Use `abstract class` instead of `class` for single-constructor Freezed models
- **Example**:

  ```dart
  // ❌ Incorrect - causes "missing concrete implementations" errors
  @freezed
  class User with _$User {
    const factory User({...}) = _User;
    factory User.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$UserFromJson(json);
  }

  // ✅ Correct - works properly with code generation
  @freezed
  abstract class User with _$User {
    const factory User({...}) = _User;
    factory User.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$UserFromJson(json);
  }
  ```

- **Reference**: [Official Freezed Documentation](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed)
- **Fixed In**: Auth models migration (2025-07-08)
- **Related Files**: `mobile/lib/features/auth/models/auth_models.dart`
